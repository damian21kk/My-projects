# Timer

This is my own project for a kind of calendar in MATLAB because MATLAB is great and who would not want to save events in MATLAB? :D My programme enables the user to input, save and checks events. The programme saves the table of events in .txt file and in a spreadsheet so that the list of events can be used and edited by other software like Excel. User can also upload an already made list of events by simply adding Timer.txt file to a path.

Feel free to play with my programme and if you have any suggestions about new functions which I can add feel free to message me. :D

Oh and BTW, I know that parallel iteration here can slow down the programme but I wanted to gain some practice in parallel programming ;)
